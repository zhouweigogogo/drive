## introduction

The intelligent driving assistance system is a software that utilizes artificial intelligence technology and multiple functions to assist drivers in driving. This system used Qtcreator and Qss to complete the software interface design, used various YOLO models such as YOLOv6lite to complete real-time video detection, and used monocular ranging algorithms to assess the risk level of the detected targets. Finally, different voice prompts were given to targets with different risk levels.

## requirements

1. Ubuntu20.04
2. Qtcreator
3. opencv
4. ncnn

## quick start

You need to put the compiled library files for NCNN and OpenCV under the `lib`ï¼Œthen compile it in Qtcreator and you can use it.
